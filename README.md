# Entity Controller

This is a plugin implementation of using a controller class to 
encapsulate business logic when dealing with Drupal content entities.

## Usage

The `entity_controller_example` shows how a this module can be used on a project.

This is based on a child module 
- providing plugins for the entity / bundle types they want to manage
- providing a factory to access the plugins (optional)

## @todo
- provide detailed usage / examples / purpose
- credit [CW Tool](https://github.com/cameronandwilding/cwtool) for idea of wrapping native Drupal objects with business logic controllers
